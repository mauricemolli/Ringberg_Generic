The conference will be held at [Ringberg Castle](https://www.schloss-ringberg.de/home), overlooking the scenic Tergensee in southern Germany. With space for roughly 50 guests on a secluded mountain top, Ringberg is a cozy spot conducive to vibrant scientific discussion, brainstorming new ideas, feasting and merriment, and (if you dare) four-person chess. 

## Accessibility

Ringberg is wheelchair accessible (see this page for more detailed [information](https://www.schloss-ringberg.de/137267/barrierefreiheit)). If you require any other accomodations for your stay at the castle, please contact the organizers.
