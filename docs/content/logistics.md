## <img height="25" src="static/img/hexagon.png"> JWST
We are aware of the JWST Cycle 2 deadline, which is on
the Friday on which the meeting ends. So it may be of
interest to some of you that there are quite a number
of rooms in Ringberg where one can work quietly.
<p style="color:red;">In addition, you can stay another night at Ringberg
(Friday 27 to Saturday 28) to finish your proposals
in the castle before traveling home. If you want to make
use of this option please indicate this when filling in the logistics
form!</p>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-virus-covid-slash"></i> COVID vigilance
Participants are required to provide proof of vaccination or recovery from COVID-19.  In addition, we will provide a rapid antigen COVID self-test for each participant for each day of the workshop.  Daily testing is mandatory for all participants. If you test positive or feel ill during the workshop, please inform the organisers immediately and we will arrange for a private room for you to self-isolate.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-coins"></i> Workshop fee
The workshop fee will be approximately €720.
This will increase by ~1/5 if you stay one extra (JWST) night on Friday. 
Payments via Master- and Visacard are accepted,
but EC-Card and cash are preferred.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-utensils"></i> Lunches & Coffee Breaks
