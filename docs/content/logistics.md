We are aware of the JWST Cycle 2 deadline, which is on
the Friday on which the meeting ends. So it may be of
interest to some of you that there are quite a number
of rooms in Ringberg where one can work quietly.
<p style="color:red;">In addition, you can stay another night at Ringberg
(Friday 27 to Saturday 28) to finish your proposals
in the castle before traveling home. If you want to make
use of this option please indicate this when filling in the logistics
form!</p>
