## <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Travel restrictions

While travel is now possible, there is still the possibility for continuously changing regulations. We'll do our best to provide support and information.
As of June 11, 2022 all COVID-19 entry restrictions to Germany are lifted, see [here](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/coronavirus/2317268).
Additionally, Ringberg Castle currently operates under 2G rules (see [here](https://www.schloss-ringberg.de/125843/corona)) whereby only vaccinated (with a Germany-approved vaccine) or recovered individuals are allowed on the premises.
We will continue to update this information, and please in all cases check with a German embassy for specific restrictions and visa requirements based on your location and citizenship.

<!--
Entry to Germany is limited to nationals from EU member states, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, and those vaccinated with [vaccines approved in Germany](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/country/germany/). Exceptions are possible for [researchers and scientists](https://www-bmi-bund-de.translate.goog/SharedDocs/faqs/DE/themen/bevoelkerungsschutz/coronavirus/reisebeschraenkungen-grenzkontrollen/IV-reisebeschraenkungen-im-aussereuropaeischen-luft-und-seeverkehr-einreisen-aus-drittstaat/welche-fachkraefte-und-hoch-qualifizierte-arbeitnehmer-duerfen-einreisen.html?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), but we recommend checking with your local German embassy to confirm if these apply to you.

## Getting to Ringberg

<!-- <p style="color:red;">Update below.</p> -->

### <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> By plane

We recommend flying to Munich Airport (MUC), as this is the nearest international airport to Ringberg.
After arrival you have to continue by train to reach the castle. Starting at Munich airport, take the regional train (S-Bahn) line S1 or S8 to Munich Central Station.
From Munich central station take the train to "Tegernsee" station. You can find train travel times by visiting the
Deutsche Bahn (German rail) [webpage](https://www.bahn.com/en). Alternatively, search for a public transport route from
"Munich airport" to "Tegernsee station" on [Google Maps](https://www.google.de/maps/dir/Munich+International+Airport,+Nordallee+25,+85356+M%C3%BCnchen-Flughafen/Tegernsee/@48.0329904,11.3529496,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m18!4m17!1m5!1m1!1s0x479e135923da6d45:0xe3c57a853a56cf4b!2m2!1d11.7764347!2d48.3509684!1m5!1m1!1s0x479d8c219a91bd33:0x41d25a40937a060!2m2!1d11.758016!2d47.7131524!2m3!6e0!7e2!8j1667743200!3e3). The total travel time is around 2 h.
From Tegernsee station you will need to take a taxi to get to the castle (15 minute ride). 

<p style="color:red;">As a large number of workshop attendants will arrive,
a taxi reservation in advance via email is mandatory (Taxi Jasinski, <a href="mailto:taxi-jasinski@live.de">taxi-jasinski@live.de</a>).</p>
Also note that on the Deutsche Bahn website you can buy a ticket in advance,
but we don't recommend the cheaper "saver" tickets,
as these apply to a specific booked train --
you cannot use them on a different train if you have flight delays.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-train"></i> By train

Please book a train to "Tegernsee" station,
once there continue to the castle with a taxi
(see details in "By Plane" section above).


### <i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Driving directions
If you decide to rent a car and drive, you can follow the directions on the [Ringberg website](https://www.schloss-ringberg.de/convention-site/contact).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i> Driving up to the castle in winter

Those who will arrive by rental car or with their own car: please note that winter equipment may be required
when driving up to the castle in case of snow! Depending on the conditions, you may need snow chains,
or a four-wheel drive. As an alternative option, guests can park
at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nHMrQQVm8xS2uWSD6">lower winter parking lot</a>
(enter Schlossstra√üe, turn right after about 50 m) and take
Taxi Jasinsky (08022/95099) or Happy Taxi (0175/9001001) up.
For a demonstration of where to park, and the snow conditions on the drive up, 
the Ringberg hosts have created a <a href="https://youtu.be/Jj0xSUXGKhQ">YouTube video</a>.
