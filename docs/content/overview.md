After decades of waiting, JWST observations of exoplanets are finally upon us! To celebrate this exciting time, we will convene for a week at Ringberg Castle.  The goal of the workshop is to bring together world experts on transiting planets, directly imaged planets, and brown dwarfs to discuss early JWST results and instrument performance, and brainstorm innovations in data analysis and atmospheric modeling needed to make the most of this once-in-a-generation telescope.  We strongly encourage participants to share early results — even if they are very preliminary — to accelerate our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and instrument performance in advance of the Cycle 2 deadline. To encourage open communication, we request that participants agree that any JWST result shared at the workshop is a private communication, and may only be used with permission.
