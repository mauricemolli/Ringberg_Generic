Clouds play a central role not only in regulating Earth's climate, but also that of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs.
Observations show that nearly every exoplanet and many brown dwarfs appear to be cloudy.
A major challenge is to accurately model the properties of these clouds.
The knowledge about the Earth and the other planets in the solar system are only of limited use,
because extrasolar clouds form in completely different conditions.
As long as the research community does not sufficiently understand clouds, determining the properties of exoplanet atmospheres,
and ultimately detecting potentially habitable (or inhabited) exoplanets, will also be impossible.
Cloud Zwei Con aims to bring together world-leading experts on the topic of clouds in exoplanet and brown dwarf
atmospheres, who study their targets with the world's most sensitive telescopes, cutting-edge models, and in the labs.
The philosophy of the workshop is to alternate presentations (keynotes and contributed) with
afternoon interdisciplinary working groups. The goal of the working groups will be to bring together observational, modeling,
and laboratory researchers to determine how best to explain existing observations and how to test model and experiment predictions.

Cloud Zwei Con is the follow-up workshop to Cloud Nine Con, which was held virtually (due to the pandemic)
in the summer of 2021, see [here](http://bit.ly/CloudNine2021).
Cloud Zwei Con will be the in-person workshop that Cloud Nine Con was originally intended to be.
Cloud Zwei Con will take place at a time when the new James Webb Space Telescope has already provided at
least six months of data on cloudy exoplanets and brown dwarfs. We expect these observations to be groundbreaking
for understanding clouds. Cloud Zwei Con thus takes place at an ideal time to provide a stage for one of the
most important questions in atmospheric research.
